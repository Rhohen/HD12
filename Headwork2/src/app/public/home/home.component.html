    Crowdsourcing relies on potentially huge numbers of on-line participants 
    to resolve data acquisition or analysis tasks. It is an exploding area that 
    impacts various domains, ranging from scientific knowledge enrichment to market 
    analysis support. But currently, existing crowd platforms rely mostly on low level
    programming paradigms, rigid data models and poor participant profiles, which 
    yields severe limitations. The low- level nature of existing solutions prevents 
    the design of complex data acquisition workflows, that could be executed, composed,
    searched and even be proposed by participants them- selves. Taking into account the
    quality, uncertainty, inconsistency and representativeness of participant 
    contributions is still an open problem. Methods for assigning a task to the correct

    participant according to his trust, motivation and expertise, automatically improving
    crowd execution time, computing optimal participant rewards, are missing. Similarly,
    usual crowd campaigns produce isolated and rigid data sets: A flexible and common 
    data model for the produced knowledge about data and participants could allow 
    participative knowledge acquisition. To overcome these challenges, Headwork will define:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rich workflow, participant, data and knowledge models to capture various kind of crowd applications 
          with complex data acquisition tasks and human specificities

          Methods for deploying, verifying, optimizing, but also monitoring and adapting crowd- based workflow 
          executions at run time.
